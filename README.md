Before getting started you need to register for an API key in order to be able to query IEX’s data.
Visit iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/.
Once you’ve confirmed your account via a confirmation email, visit https://iexcloud.io/console/tokens.
Copy the key that appears under the Token column (it should begin with pk_).
In your terminal window, execute: $ export API_KEY=value
